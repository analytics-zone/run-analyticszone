    <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
    <div itemprop="text">
      <p><strong>Training Stress Score (TSS)</strong> is a metric that quantifies workout intensity and duration into a single number representing training load. For running (rTSS), it's calculated as: <strong>Duration (hours) × Intensity Factor² × 100</strong>, where Intensity Factor = Workout Pace / Critical Running Speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Key Facts:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1-hour workout at threshold pace = 100 TSS</li>
        <li>Tracks cumulative fitness (CTL), fatigue (ATL), and form (TSB)</li>
        <li>Weekly targets: 300-500 TSS (recreational) to 800-1200+ TSS (elite)</li>
        <li>Helps prevent overtraining while ensuring adequate training stimulus</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <p>Training Stress Score (TSS) quantifies the training load of individual workouts and cumulative training stress over time. Originally developed for cycling, TSS has been adapted for running (rTSS) to help athletes balance training intensity, manage fatigue, and optimize performance. Understanding TSS enables data-driven training decisions that prevent overtraining while ensuring adequate stimulus for adaptation.</p>

    <p>This comprehensive guide explains what TSS is, how it's calculated for running, how to use TSS metrics like CTL (fitness), ATL (fatigue), and TSB (form) to manage your training, and how to integrate TSS into different training phases. Whether you're training for a 5K or marathon, TSS provides objective feedback that subjective assessment cannot match.</p>

    <p>Training Stress Score is a single number that represents the overall training load of a workout, accounting for both duration and intensity. Unlike simply tracking miles or time, TSS weights intensity appropriately: a 60-minute tempo run creates more training stress than a 60-minute easy run.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts Behind TSS</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective Quantification:</strong> TSS provides a standardized metric to compare different workouts—intervals vs tempo vs long runs</li>
      <li><strong>Intensity Weighting:</strong> Higher intensity workouts generate disproportionately more stress than duration alone would suggest</li>
      <li><strong>Cumulative Tracking:</strong> TSS can be summed daily, weekly, and over training cycles to track total training load</li>
      <li><strong>Individual Calibration:</strong> TSS is personalized to your threshold, making it specific to your fitness level</li>
      <li><strong>Fatigue Management:</strong> TSS-derived metrics (CTL, ATL, TSB) predict fitness, fatigue, and optimal training load</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>rTSS: TSS for Running</h2>

    <p>While TSS was originally developed using cycling power data, rTSS (running Training Stress Score) adapts the concept for running using pace instead of power. The fundamental formula structure remains the same, but rTSS uses your <a href="/en/crs/">Critical Running Speed (CRS)</a> or threshold pace as the baseline.</p>

    <h3>Why CRS for rTSS?</h3>

    <p>CRS represents your sustainable aerobic-anaerobic transition speed—essentially your "functional threshold pace." Using CRS as the reference point ensures:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Personalized intensity calculation specific to your physiology</li>
      <li>Accurate comparison across different runner ability levels</li>
      <li>Proper weighting of intensity relative to your actual capabilities</li>
      <li>Consistency with scientifically validated metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Alternative threshold markers include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>30-minute test pace:</strong> Functional threshold pace from 30-min time trial</li>
      <li><strong>10K race pace + 10-15 sec/mile:</strong> Estimated threshold from recent 10K</li>
      <li><strong>Lactate threshold pace:</strong> From laboratory or field lactate testing</li>
    </ul>

          <td>Cardiac drift inflates scores, lag time in intervals, varies with conditions</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>For most runners, pace-based rTSS provides more consistent and actionable data, especially when training on measured courses or tracks. Heart rate-based TSS works better for trail running where pace is unreliable.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="calculating-tss">
    <h2>How to Calculate rTSS</h2>

    <p>The rTSS formula accounts for both workout duration and intensity relative to your threshold:</p>

    <pre>rTSS = (Duration in seconds × IF² × 100) / 3600

Where:
IF = Intensity Factor (workout pace / CRS pace)
Duration = Total workout time in seconds</pre>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Calculation Example</h3>

    <p><strong>Workout:</strong> 60-minute tempo run at 4:00/km pace<br>
    <strong>Your CRS:</strong> 4:20/km (270 m/min or 4.5 m/s)</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1: Convert paces to m/s</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Workout pace: 4:00/km = 4.17 m/s</li>
      <li>CRS pace: 4:20/km = 3.85 m/s</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate Intensity Factor (IF)</strong></p>
    <pre>IF = Workout pace / CRS pace
IF = 4.17 / 3.85 = 1.08</pre>

    <p><strong>Step 3: Calculate rTSS</strong></p>
    <pre>Duration = 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds
rTSS = (3,600 × 1.08² × 100) / 3,600
rTSS = (3,600 × 1.166 × 100) / 3,600
rTSS = 116.6 ≈ 117</pre>

    <p>This 60-minute tempo run at 108% of CRS generates 117 rTSS—slightly more stress than an hour at threshold would produce (which equals 100 TSS by definition).</p>

    <h3>Quick rTSS Calculator</h3>

    <p>Use our <a href="/en/stss-calculator/">free rTSS calculator</a> to quickly compute TSS for your workouts without manual calculation. Simply enter your CRS, workout pace, and duration.</p>

    <h3>rTSS for Mixed Workouts</h3>

    <p>For workouts with multiple segments at different intensities (intervals, progressive runs), calculate TSS for each segment and sum them:</p>

    <p><strong>Example: Interval Workout</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>15 min warm-up (60% CRS): IF = 0.60, TSS = 9</li>
      <li>6 × 4 min at 110% CRS (24 min total): IF = 1.10, TSS = 48</li>
      <li>Recovery between intervals (12 min at 50% CRS): IF = 0.50, TSS = 2</li>
      <li>10 min cool-down (60% CRS): IF = 0.60, TSS = 6</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Total Workout rTSS:</strong> 9 + 48 + 2 + 6 = 65 rTSS</p>

    <p>Notice that most of the training stress comes from the interval segments despite being less than half the workout duration—this demonstrates TSS's proper intensity weighting.</p>

  <section id="intensity-factor">
    <h2>Understanding Intensity Factor (IF)</h2>

    <p>Intensity Factor is the ratio of your workout pace to your threshold pace. It represents how hard you're working relative to your maximum sustainable aerobic effort.</p>

    </table>

    <p><em>TSS per hour = IF² × 100. For example, Zone 2 at IF 0.75 generates 56 TSS per hour.</em></p>

    <h3>Why IF is Squared</h3>

    <p>The quadratic relationship (IF²) reflects the exponential increase in physiological stress as intensity rises:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>IF 0.80 (easy run):</strong> Generates 64 TSS per hour</li>
      <li><strong>IF 0.90 (tempo):</strong> Generates 81 TSS per hour (+27%)</li>
      <li><strong>IF 1.00 (threshold):</strong> Generates 100 TSS per hour (+24%)</li>
      <li><strong>IF 1.10 (VO2max):</strong> Generates 121 TSS per hour (+21%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A 10% increase in pace (from 0.80 to 0.90 IF) increases training stress by 27%, not just 10%. This accurately reflects that running slightly faster requires disproportionately more energy and creates greater fatigue.</p>

    <h2>CTL, ATL, and TSB Metrics</h2>

    <p>TSS for individual workouts is useful, but the real power comes from tracking cumulative metrics over time. Three derived metrics manage long-term training load:</p>

    <h3>Chronic Training Load (CTL): Fitness</h3>

    <p>CTL is your long-term training load, calculated as an exponentially weighted 42-day moving average of daily TSS. CTL represents your fitness—your capacity to absorb training stress.</p>

    <pre>CTL(today) = CTL(yesterday) + (TSS(today) - CTL(yesterday)) / 42</pre>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher CTL:</strong> Greater fitness and work capacity</li>
      <li><strong>Increasing CTL:</strong> Building fitness (but also accumulating fatigue)</li>
      <li><strong>Stable CTL:</strong> Maintaining fitness level</li>
      <li><strong>Declining CTL:</strong> Detraining (intentional taper or unplanned)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acute Training Load (ATL): Fatigue</h3>

    <p>ATL is your short-term training load, calculated as an exponentially weighted 7-day moving average of daily TSS. ATL represents your fatigue—the impact of recent training.</p>

    <pre>ATL(today) = ATL(yesterday) + (TSS(today) - ATL(yesterday)) / 7</pre>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher ATL:</strong> More accumulated fatigue</li>
      <li><strong>ATL > CTL:</strong> Significant fatigue relative to fitness (overreaching or overtraining risk)</li>
      <li><strong>ATL << CTL:</strong> Well-recovered, ready for hard training</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Training Stress Balance (TSB): Form</h3>

    <p>TSB is the difference between fitness and fatigue. It predicts your form—readiness to perform or train hard.</p>

    <pre>TSB = CTL - ATL</pre>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>TSB = -30 to -10:</strong> High fatigue, productive overload phase</li>
      <li><strong>TSB = -10 to +5:</strong> Optimal training range, good balance</li>
      <li><strong>TSB = +5 to +15:</strong> Fresh, tapered, race-ready</li>
      <li><strong>TSB = +15 to +25:</strong> Very fresh, peak form for key race</li>
      <li><strong>TSB > +25:</strong> Detraining, lost fitness</li>

    <p>Higher CTL provides greater race-specific endurance and resilience. However, rapid CTL increases risk injury—limit CTL growth to 5-8 points per week maximum.</p>

    <h3>TSS Ramping Guidelines</h3>

    <p>Progressive overload requires steady TSS increases, but too rapid growth risks injury and overtraining:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maximum weekly increase:</strong> 5-10% increase in weekly TSS</li>
      <li><strong>Maximum CTL increase:</strong> 5-8 CTL points per week</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery weeks:</strong> Every 3-4 weeks, reduce TSS by 30-50%</li>
      <li><strong>Injury/illness:</strong> After layoff, return at 50% previous TSS, add 10% per week</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recovery Week TSS</h3>

    <p>Scheduled recovery weeks prevent overtraining and allow adaptation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Every 3-4 weeks</li>
      <li><strong>TSS reduction:</strong> 30-50% of previous week</li>
      <li><strong>Intensity maintenance:</strong> Keep some quality work but reduce volume significantly</li>
      <li><strong>CTL impact:</strong> Minimal CTL decrease (1-3 points) but significant ATL decrease (10-20 points)</li>
      <li><strong>TSB improvement:</strong> TSB should rise to +5 to +15 during recovery week</li>

    <h2>Using TSS for Training Management</h2>

    <p>TSS transforms from interesting data into actionable guidance when applied to training decisions.</p>

    <h3>Planning Weekly TSS</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Establish baseline:</strong> Track 2-3 weeks of current training to determine sustainable weekly TSS</li>
      <li><strong>Set target CTL:</strong> Determine goal CTL for your target race (see tables above)</li>
      <li><strong>Calculate required TSS:</strong> Work backward from goal CTL to determine weekly TSS needed</li>
      <li><strong>Plan ramp rate:</strong> Increase weekly TSS by 5-10% maximum per week</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule recovery:</strong> Every 3-4 weeks, reduce TSS by 30-50%</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Example: Building from CTL 50 to CTL 85 for marathon</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Current CTL: 50 (current weekly TSS ~350)</li>
      <li>Goal CTL: 85 (requires weekly TSS ~595)</li>
      <li>Weeks available: 16 weeks</li>
      <li>Required CTL increase: 35 points</li>
      <li>Sustainable rate: ~2.2 CTL points per week</li>
      <li>Weekly TSS progression: 350 → 385 → 420 → 455 → 490 → 525 → 560 → 595</li>
      <li>With recovery weeks factored: Achieve goal CTL with buffer for taper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using TSB for Workout Timing</h3>

    <p>TSB predicts readiness for hard training or racing:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>TSB Range</th>
          <th>Readiness</th>
          <th>Recommended Training</th>

          <td>Key workouts, hard training, progressive overload</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-5 to +5</td>
          <td>Balanced</td>
          <td>Moderate training, good for tempo/threshold work</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>> +25</td>

          <td>Extended taper, possible detraining—resume training</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Practical applications:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Schedule key workouts when TSB is -5 to +5</li>
      <li>If TSB drops below -20, consider extra rest day</li>
      <li>Target TSB of +15 to +25 for goal races</li>
      <li>If TSB exceeds +25 mid-season, increase training load</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Taper Management with TSS</h3>

    <h2>Common TSS Mistakes</h2>

    <h3>1. Chasing TSS Numbers</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Treating TSS as a score to maximize rather than a management tool.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> More TSS is not always better. Excessive TSS without adequate recovery leads to overtraining, injury, and performance decline.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use TSS to ensure adequate stimulus while respecting recovery needs. Quality matters more than quantity.</p>

    <h3>2. Ignoring Intensity Distribution</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Hitting weekly TSS targets with too much Zone 3 "gray zone" training.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> 500 weekly TSS from mostly Zone 3 work produces worse results than 500 TSS with proper 80/20 distribution. You accumulate fatigue without sufficient hard or easy training stimulus.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Track TSS by zone. Ensure 75-85% comes from easy running, with hard work truly hard (Zone 4-5).</p>

    <h3>3. Rapid CTL Ramping</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Increasing CTL by 10+ points per week to "catch up" on fitness.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> Connective tissue adaptation lags cardiovascular adaptation. Rapid TSS increases cause injury even if you feel aerobically ready for the load.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Limit CTL increases to 5-8 points per week maximum. Include recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks.</p>

    <h3>4. Neglecting Individual Response</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Following generic TSS guidelines without adjusting for individual recovery capacity.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> Recovery varies by age, training history, sleep quality, stress, and genetics. A 500 TSS week may be perfect for one runner and overwhelming for another of the same ability level.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use TSS guidelines as starting points. Monitor performance, sleep, motivation, and resting heart rate. Adjust TSS targets based on individual response.</p>

    <h3>5. Overvaluing External TSS Estimates</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Relying on smartwatch TSS estimates without understanding calculation methods.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> Many watches use proprietary algorithms that don't align with standard TSS methodology. Some overestimate, others underestimate. Inconsistent calculations make trend tracking unreliable.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a consistent calculation method based on CRS or threshold pace. Our <a href="/en/stss-calculator/">rTSS calculator</a> uses validated methodology for accurate, consistent results.</p>

    <h3>6. Comparing TSS Between Runners</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Assuming equal TSS means equal training stimulus for different runners.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> TSS is relative to individual threshold. A 100 TSS workout for an elite runner (e.g., 60 minutes at 5:30/mile threshold pace) differs dramatically from 100 TSS for a recreational runner (60 minutes at 9:00/mile threshold pace).</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use TSS only for self-comparison over time. Never compare absolute TSS values between athletes.</p>

    <h3>7. Neglecting Non-Running Stress</h3>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Managing TSS perfectly but ignoring life stress, work demands, and non-running factors.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> Total stress (not just training stress) determines recovery needs and performance. High life stress + high TSS = overtraining.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Reduce TSS targets during high-stress life periods. Monitor HRV, sleep quality, and subjective fatigue. Adjust training based on total stress load, not just TSS.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What's a good TSS for a long run?</h3>
      <p>Long run TSS varies by duration and pace. A typical marathon training long run (16-20 miles at easy pace, IF 0.75-0.80) generates 150-250 TSS. Very long runs (20+ miles) or faster long runs can reach 250-350 TSS. The long run should represent 25-35% of weekly TSS in most training plans.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much TSS is too much in one workout?</h3>
      <p>Single workout TSS above 300 requires 2-3 days recovery; above 450 requires 4-7 days. Most training workouts should be 80-200 TSS. Reserve 300+ TSS workouts for key long runs, races, or specific peak phase training. More than one 300+ TSS workout per week risks excessive fatigue for most runners.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I calculate TSS for treadmill runs?</h3>
      <p>Yes, TSS calculation works identically for treadmill running using pace data. However, treadmill pace should be set to 1% incline to match outdoor effort. If comparing treadmill and outdoor TSS, ensure consistency—don't switch between methods and expect identical values, as running mechanics differ slightly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Should I count cross-training in my weekly TSS?</h3>
      <p>For specificity, calculate running TSS separately from cross-training. Cycling, swimming, and other activities create training stress but different adaptations. If you track total training load across all sports, use separate TSS calculations for each (rTSS for running, standard TSS for cycling, sTSS for swimming). Most runners benefit from tracking running TSS exclusively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do I set my CRS for accurate rTSS calculation?</h3>
      <p>Perform a proper CRS test: 3-minute and 7-minute maximum effort trials with 30 minutes recovery between. Calculate CRS = (D7 - D3) / 4. Retest every 6-8 weeks as fitness improves. Alternatively, use 30-minute time trial pace or 10K race pace + 10-15 seconds per mile. Accurate CRS is critical for meaningful TSS data. See our <a href="/en/crs/">CRS calculator</a> for detailed testing protocol.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>What TSB should I target for a goal race?</h3>
      <p>Target TSB of +15 to +25 for A-priority races. For B races (tune-ups), TSB of +5 to +15 is appropriate. C races (training runs) can be done at TSB of -5 to +5. Higher TSB (freshness) improves performance but requires longer taper. Balance race importance against training continuity when setting TSB targets.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How quickly does CTL decay during injury?</h3>
      <p>CTL decreases at approximately 1 point per day of complete rest, or 7 points per week. However, physiological fitness decays slower than CTL suggests. After 2 weeks off (CTL drop of ~14 points), actual fitness loss is only 5-10%. Cross-training can maintain 50-70% of running fitness, slowing CTL decay. When returning from injury, rebuild CTL gradually at 3-5 points per week maximum.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is TSS accurate for trail running and hills?</h3>
      <p>Pace-based TSS is less accurate on trails and significant hills because pace doesn't reflect effort. For trail running, heart rate-based hrTSS provides better accuracy. Alternatively, use power-based TSS if you have a running power meter—power accounts for grade and terrain. For hilly road running with GPS, pace-based TSS remains reasonably accurate over full workout duration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I use TSS with heart rate zones instead of pace?</h3>
      <p>Yes, hrTSS uses heart rate relative to LTHR (lactate threshold heart rate) instead of pace relative to CRS. Formula is identical: hrTSS = (Duration × IF²) / 36, where IF = average HR / LTHR. hrTSS works well for terrain where pace is unreliable. However, cardiac drift can inflate hrTSS on long runs—pace-based rTSS is more consistent for flat, measured courses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What's the relationship between TSS and weekly mileage?</h3>
      <p>TSS and mileage correlate but aren't interchangeable. A 50-mile week at easy pace (IF 0.75) generates ~450 TSS. The same 50 miles with intense workouts might generate 550-650 TSS. TSS accounts for intensity that mileage alone misses. Two runners with identical weekly mileage can have vastly different TSS and fatigue levels depending on intensity distribution. Use both metrics together for complete picture.</p>
